# Task 4


*User Story*

> As a user of this application,
> I want to be able to filter tasks/things/todos by category
> so that I can hide/show categories of, or all tasks/things/todos in my list


*Notes*:

- Use behaviors implemented in previous tasks
- Add elements that allow the user to filter tasks/things/todos by category or see all todos in all categories
    - task/thing/todo 'delete' behavior should be updated to ask the user if they're sure they want to delete `{category} {todo}`
      - based on their choice, the task/thing/todo is either deleted or not
    - when a task/thing/todo is deleted, if it is the last todo in its category, the category should also be deleted/removed.


*When finished*:

Start [task 5](../task5/README.md)
