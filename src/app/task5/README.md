# Task 5


*User Story*

> As a user of this application,
> I want to also be able to edit a task/thing/todo's category when I edit the task/thing/todo
> so that I can keep my lists accurate


*Notes*:

- Use behaviors implemented in previous tasks
- The lines in the list created in task 1 should still contain a clickable element for 'edit'
  - when the 'edit' element is clicked, an edit screen should still be opened for the appropriate task/thing/todo
    - the edit screen should have a form in it
      - the form should have an input element that reflects current task/thing/todo value
      - the form should also have an input element that contains current category for the task/thing/todo value
      - when the form is submitted, the task/thing/todo AND category are still stored into and/or updated in the data service
        - after the task/thing/todo and category are saved, the user is taken back to the list of tasks/things/todos


*When finished*:

Save everything. Push up to your favorite git-flavored repo, and send a link to your HeroDevs recruiter!

GOOD JOB!
