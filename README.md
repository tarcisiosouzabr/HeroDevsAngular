## Project Overview

This repository is a shell of an Angular application. The READMEs will lead you through a series of tasks intended to have you work within and implement a number of common concerns. It starts with the next section.

## Tasks

There are numbered task directories which are separate silos for implementation with instructions contained within the corresponding README.md file. Each README should link and lead you to the next README.

If you have any explanations regarding your implementation for a given task, (eg- decisions made, shortcuts taken, etc), there are COMMENTS.md files in each task component directory.

Start [here](src/app/README.md).
