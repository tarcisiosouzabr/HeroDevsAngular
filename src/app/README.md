# Getting Started


*User Story*: 

> As a user of this application,
> I need to be able to navigate from task to task and see each task component's content
> so that I can easily make determinations about how and what was implemented


*Notes*:

- Establish routing in the app such that each task* component is navigable
- `task1` is to be the default route presented to the user when either:
    1. No route is entered
    2. A non-existent app route is navigated to
- Add navigation links to, and render route-specific task* content in App component

*When finished*:

Start [task 1](./task1/README.md)
