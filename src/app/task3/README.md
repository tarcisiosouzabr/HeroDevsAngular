# Task 3


*User Story*

> As a user of this application,
> I want to be able to group tasks/things/todos together
> so that I can group tasks/things/todos logically


*Notes*:

- Use behaviors implemented in previous tasks
- Add another input that allows the user to create a category or select a category from a list of previously created categories
  - category should be a string
  - categories should exist and persist in/to the data service
- When a new task/thing/todo is created, it should now be associated with/to a group
- These new behaviors should be implemented and/or usable within the Task3Component route


*When finished*:

Start [task 4](../task4/README.md)
