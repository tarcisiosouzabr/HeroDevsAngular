# Task 2


*User Story*

> As a user of this application,
> I want to be able to edit things/tasks/todos that I have already created
> so that I don't have to delete and recreate them when I make a mistake


*Notes*:

- Use behaviors implemented in previous task
- The lines in the list created in task 1 should contain a clickable element for 'edit'
  - when the 'edit' element is clicked, an edit screen is opened for the appropriate task/thing/todo
    - the edit screen should have a form with an element that contains current task/thing/todo value
      - when the form is submitted, the task/thing/todo is stored into and/or updated in the data service
        - after the todo is saved, the user is taken back to the list of todos
- These new behaviors should be implemented and/or usable within the Task2Component route

*When finished*:

Start [task 3](../task3/README.md)
